Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw4-1-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write each program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


1. In the group stage of the FIFA World Cup, a team earns 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and no points for a loss. Write a program that propmts the user to input the number of wins and ties for 2 teams, calculates the total points each team earned in the group stage, and displays a statement stating which team finished with more points during the group stage. Be sure to use if and/or if-else statements.

2. Create a program that determines if you are safe or bust in blackjack. Prompt the user for the value of their 2 cards and display if they are safe or busted. Note: Jack, Queen, and King are all worth 10, and if the sum of your cards is under 21, then you are safe.

3. Write a program that tests if a given number is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5. Display the result of whether it is divisible by each number on a separate line.
